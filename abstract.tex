\chapter*{Abstract}
Many theoretical studies and experimental results rely on the use of numerical analysis for the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. Indeed, for nontrivial quantum systems, a complete solution of the dynamics is difficult to achieve analytically. We extended the implementation of a highly optimized solver to simulate the evolution of a wave function on a 2D lattice. We also implemented the imaginary time evolution to approximate the ground state. The dynamics of the system is now described by an Hamiltonian that includes an external potential and a contact interaction term. The algorithm is based on the second-order Trotter--Suzuki approximation and it is implemented on CPU and GPU kernels that run efficiently on a cluster. We proved the accuracy of the code solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate and reproducing the experimental results, obtained at NIST, of the soliton dynamics in a cloud of sodium atoms. The code is available under an open source license, and it is exposed as an application program interface. The code is also accessible in Python and MATLAB. Future development of the code include the extension to a 3D lattice, whereas the actual implementation can already find applications in ultracold atom physics.
