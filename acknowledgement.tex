\noindent This Thesis project has been carried out during my Erasmus internship at The Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Barcelona. Special thanks are given to my supervisors Peter Wittek and Toni Ac√≠n for having me in their research group and for all the great support they gave me.
Also, I like to thank Pietro Massignan for his invaluable support in the physical application of the code.
Thanks to all the ICFOnians who made my internship an enjoyable and productive experience.
